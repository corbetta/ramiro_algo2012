b) fastest still perceptible speed

find the fastest speed for the square to move across the screen and have the motion be still perceived as continuous (not discrete jumps). Time how long it takes for the square to move across the screen and measure the physical (not pixel) distance. What is this speed in inches/second ? What is this rate in mph?
